# Personal AI Orchestrator

This repository contains a production-oriented personal AI assistant
core, designed around strict orchestration, routing, and local LLM
inference.

## Design Principles
- Orchestrator-first architecture
- LLMs are stateless workers
- Deterministic business logic
- Hard latency and cost guardrails

## Current Stage
System design and local inference stabilization.

## Non-goals (for now)
- End-user UI polish
- Fine-tuning
- RAG
